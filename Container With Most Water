Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Notice that you may not slant the container.

 

Example 1:


Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
Example 2:

Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16
Example 4:

Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

n == height.length
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= height[i] <= 104



/*
Notes....
rect area = width*length
width = min(height[left],height[right]) need the min height of left and right
store the max 
continue to the rest of the height by moving (left/right) the smallest height
*/

class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int left=0;
        int right = height.length-1;
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        while(left<=right){
           int min = Math.min(height[left],height[right]);
           int area = (right-left) * min;
           max = Math.max(area,max);
            if(height[left]<height[right]){
                left++;
            }
            else{
                right--;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
}
