You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
 

Constraints:

1 <= prices.length <= 105
0 <= prices[i] <= 104


/*
min 7 if lesser number then that is min 
max 1 if higher number than change to it
first loop min = 1 
if(price[i] < min ) max=0 ; min=price[i];
if(max<price[i]) max = price[i];
end return price[max] - price[min]

min = 7 -> 6 _> 4 -> 3 -> 1
max = 0 -> 0 -> 0-> 0 -> ->
if(price[max] - price[min] <0){
return 0;
}

        int max= Integer.MIN_VALUE; //both max & min hold a value of prices
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
