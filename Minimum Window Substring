Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
Example 2:

Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
Example 3:

Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
 

Constraints:

m == s.length
n == t.length
1 <= m, n <= 105
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

time complexity = n= string s 
m=string t. 
n+m because we are comparing the two strings with each other

/*
Step 1 = create hashmap.= to insert string "t" char,int . this will show how many of the same char is in the string
step 2 = create variables. count = hashmap.size(). minLength.  
step 3 = create sliding window. = with i & j. If char of j is in hashmap then decrease the value in hashmap and in count(only decrease count when hashmap value is == 0). i will increase the hashmap and only increase count when the hashmap value is > 0
step 4 = create nested while loop. 1) j < s.length(). move j til the end 2) count == 0 i will move until finds char contains in map.
step 5 = if j-i < minLength, then only save the substring of minimum string values.
step 6 = create found boolean so if char from T was Not in A then return empty string.

"ADOBECODEBANC"
      ^      ^
map = A=0 B=0 C=0
count = 3,2,1,0, 1,0,1,0
count will only decrease when A or B or C == 0 and not < 0 ALSO count will only increase when the maps are >0
i,j = beginning 
i=0
j=6
left=0   right= end
minlength=13, 6
right =i
left = j
